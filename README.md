# Abstract Clone - Frontend Practice

Clone webpage of [Abstract](https://help.abstract.com/hc/en-us) site, made as a Level 1 challenge on [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/abstract). Challenge is to recreate the first page only, as better as you can, with colors and free icon assets given. Also, there are helpful articles and resources for beginners that are new to HTML and CSS. I've gone a step further, by making this responsive too.
